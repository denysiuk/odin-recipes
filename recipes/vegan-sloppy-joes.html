        <li>1 quart vegetable broth, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 green bell pepper (about ¾ cup diced)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion (about 1 cup diced)</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup plus 2 tablespoons organic ketchup, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegan Worcestershire sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon <strong>each</strong> mustard powder, onion powder, and chili powder</li>
        <li>Hot sauce, to taste</li>
        <li>Pickled onions, to serve</li>
        <li>Bread and butter pickles, to serve</li>
        <li>8 whole wheat buns (make sure they are vegan, use gluten-free as desired)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the lentils:</strong> In a large saucepan, place the lentils with 3 cups of the vegetable
            broth, 2 cups water, and ½ teaspoon kosher salt. Bring to a rapid simmer. Reduce the heat and simmer
            uncovered for about 20 to 25 minutes, until the lentils are tender but still hold their shape (start tasting
            at 15 minutes; the exact timing depends on the heat level and your pan size). Drain the excess liquid.</li>
        <li><strong>Meanwhile, make the sauce:</strong> Once you’ve started the lentils, dice the bell pepper. Dice the
            onion. Mince the garlic.</li>
        <li>In another large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the bell pepper and onion and cook
            5 minutes until the onions are translucent. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add vegetable broth, 1 cup
            ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and chili powder. Simmer for 5 minutes until
            thickened.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the lentils to the sauce:</strong> When the lentils are done, add them to the sauce. Cook on low
            heat for about 5 minutes. Then remove the heat and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons ketchup, 1 teaspoon
            Worcestershire sauce, and ½ teaspoon kosher salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve on a bun with pickled onions and pickles. (If desired, toast the buns prior to
            serving.) Make ahead: Leftovers save well for 3 to 4 days. Make in advance, refrigerate and then reheat in a
            saucepan. Add an extra squeeze of ketchup if it seems dry.</li>
    </ol>
